First of all, you will need to install [boot] (https://github.com/boot-clj/boot).

It is great tool like leiningen, but sometimes leiningen is overhead.

For *Linux/OS X* you can simple type this:
```sh
sudo bash -c "cd /usr/local/bin && curl -fsSLo boot https://github.com/boot-clj/boot-bin/releases/download/latest/boot.sh && chmod 755 boot"
```
For run example agent type this:
```sh
boot example 
```
